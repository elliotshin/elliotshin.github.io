## Introduction
Hello! Today we will be learning how to set up a web app using the flask package in python! For starters, it is important to create a folder for the project we will be running today!

After you have set up your folder and have navigated to it within your command prompt, you are going to need to run the following commands in your command prompt to set up your flask project:
 **conda activate pic16B**
 **export FLASK_ENV=development** (only have to run this once)
 **flask run**(will have to run this everytime you create a new session)

 Great! Now that that is all settled, let's start developing.

## HTML Design
Prior to the backend development of the app, we should first discuss how to create templates. These are HTML documents created that will allow us to give the user an interface to interact with. These will also incoprorate Jinja tags to allow for interactions with python code! 

# Main.html
```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
	<h1>Welcome to this webpage! Click one of  the above links to get started!</h1>
{% endblock %}



{% endraw %}

```

Let's examine our most simple example, the main.html template.
The {} are our jinja tags, these allow for python interactivity. This is just a simple example, but we are doing this to demonstrate the difference between the jinja tags, and the html tags, which are denoted as <>. Let's look at what we have created!

As you can see, the 'h1' tag in the above code is responsible for the header of the page! That is because h1 stands for 'header 1'

# View.html 
Next we are going to examine the view.html template, or what the user will see when they choose to view messages submitted by other users!

```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
	<h1>{% block title %}Message Viewer{% endblock %}</h1> 	
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	{% for message in messages %}
		<br><br>{{message[0]}}: {{message[1]}}, {{message[2]}}
	{% endfor %}
{% endblock %} 


{% endraw %}

```
In this example, the jinja tags are more complex, so let's break it down! 
First you will notice the jinja tags that extend 'base.html'. These are used to extend our base.template, in which our navigation menu is stored. 
The biggest thing of note for the jinja tags here is the use of a for loop that prints variables passed to it. As you can see, the jinja syntax for for loops is quite similar to the python syntax. In
