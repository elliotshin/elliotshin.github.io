## Introduction
The link to the repository we will be working off of today is: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/elliotshin/blogpost3) 

(https://github.com/elliotshin/blogpost3)

Hello! Today we will be learning how to set up a web app using the flask package in python! For starters, it is important to create a folder for the project we will be running today!

After you have set up your folder and have navigated to it within your command prompt, you are going to need to run the following commands in your command prompt to set up your flask project:
 **conda activate pic16B**
 **export FLASK_ENV=development** (only have to run this once)
 **flask run**(will have to run this everytime you create a new session)

 Great! Now that that is all settled, let's start developing.

## HTML Design
Prior to the backend development of the app, we should first discuss how to create templates. These are HTML documents created that will allow us to give the user an interface to interact with. These will also incoprorate Jinja tags to allow for interactions with python code! 

# Main.html
```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
	<h1>Welcome to this webpage! Click one of  the above links to get started!</h1>
{% endblock %}
-


{% endraw %}

```

Let's examine our most simple example, the main.html template.
The {} are our jinja tags, these allow for python interactivity. This is just a simple example, but we are doing this to demonstrate the difference between the jinja tags, and the html tags, which are denoted as <>. Let's look at what we have created! 

![mainpage](/images/mainpage.png)

As you can see, the 'h1' tag in the above code is responsible for the header of the page! That is because h1 stands for 'header 1'

# View.html 
Next we are going to examine the view.html template, or what the user will see when they choose to view messages submitted by other users!

```html
{% raw %}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
	<h1>{% block title %}Message Viewer{% endblock %}</h1> 	
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	{% for message in messages %}
		<br><br>{{message[0]}}: {{message[1]}}, {{message[2]}}
	{% endfor %}
{% endblock %} 


{% endraw %}

```
In this example, the jinja tags are more complex, so let's break it down! 
First you will notice the jinja tags that extend 'base.html'. These are used to extend our base.template, in which our navigation menu is stored. 
The biggest thing of note for the jinja tags here is the use of a for loop that prints variables passed to it. As you can see, the jinja syntax for for loops is quite similar to the python syntax. Seeing as the template is called "view", you are correct in assuming that the for loop will be what enables viewing of the submissions! The message[0],message[1], and message[3] are the components of the data that is being sent to the template. But how does the data get sent to the template?

# WebApp

## The Big Picture
Before we get into details of our code, lets look at what it will look like at the end! 
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, Blueprint, g, url_for, abort
import sqlite3 
 

def get_message_db():
	"""This function checks whether there is a database called message_db in the g attribute of the app. 
	If not, then connect to that database, ensuring that the connection is an attribute of g"""
	if 'message_db' not in g:
		g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('messages.sqlite') #connection established

		#query to create sqlite table
		messages_table_query = """ CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
			id INTEGER,
			handle TEXT NOT NULL,
			message TEXT NOT NULL
		); """
		c = g.message_db.cursor()
		#creates sqlite table
		c.execute(messages_table_query)
		print("sqlite3 connected")
	return g.message_db

def close_message_db(e = None):
	"""This method breaks the connection to the database and closes it"""
	db = g.pop('message_db', None) #popping the element releases the connection, if no database, return none 

	if db is not None:
		print("sqlite3 closed")
		db.close()


def insert_message(request):
	"""
	Extracts the message and the handle from request. 
	inserts the message into the message database
	"""
	handle = request.form['handle']
	usermessage = request.form['usermessage']
	print(handle,usermessage)
	db = get_message_db()
	c = db.cursor()
	x = c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows FROM messages') 
	test = x.fetchone()
	print(test)
	print(type(test))
	(ID,) = test
	ID = ID + 1
	print(ID)
	insert_query = """INSERT OR IGNORE INTO messages (id,handle, message) VALUES (?,?,?)"""
	val = (ID, handle, usermessage)
	c.execute(insert_query,val)  
	print("executed order 66")
	db.commit()
	print("db committed")
	print("finished insert_message method")

def random_messages(n):
	"""
	returns a collection of n random messages from the message_db, or fewer if necessary
	"""
	db = get_message_db();
	c = db.cursor();
	rows = c.execute('SELECT id FROM messages').fetchall()[-1]
	(rows,) = rows
	print(n,rows)
	if (rows < n):
		n = rows
		rando_query = """SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ? """
		c.execute(rando_query,(n,))
	else:
		rando_query = """SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ? """
		c.execute(rando_query,(n,))
	return c
app = Flask(__name__) 

@app.route("/")
def main():
	return render_template("main.html")
#controls what url the page you develop will have
#root directory

@app.route("/submit/", methods = ["POST", "GET"])
def submit():
	if request.method == "GET":
		return render_template("submit.html")
	if request.method == "POST":
		insert_message(request)
		print("message inserted") 
		return render_template("submit.html", handle = request.form["handle"], usermessage = request.form["usermessage"], thanks = True) 

@app.route("/view/")
def view():
	db = get_message_db()
	rand_messages = random_messages(5)
	messages = rand_messages.fetchall()
	return render_template('view.html', messages = messages) 
	



app.teardown_appcontext(close_message_db)

```
It is quite a lot to behold! But let's break it down now

### The get_message_db() function
The get_message_db() function is designed to do two things: First, it checks to make sure that there is a database present in our global object, g. If there isn't one, then the function creates a database titled messages with columns id, handle, and message. Following that it creates a cursor, c that executes the query to create our table! Finally, it returns our connection! 

```python
def get_message_db():
	"""This function checks whether there is a database called message_db in the g attribute of the app. 
	If not, then connect to that database, ensuring that the connection is an attribute of g"""
	if 'message_db' not in g:
		g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('messages.sqlite') #connection established

		#query to create sqlite table
		messages_table_query = """ CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
			id INTEGER,
			handle TEXT NOT NULL,
			message TEXT NOT NULL
		); """
		c = g.message_db.cursor()
		#creates sqlite table
		c.execute(messages_table_query)
		print("sqlite3 connected")
	return g.message_db


```

### The insert_message() method
The insert_message() method is responsible for reading in the request object and taking in user input from the request object. It then commits the messages into the messages database created earlier. The challenging part of this function is making sure your SQL query is properly formatted! See the comments below for clearer instructions! 
```python
def insert_message(request):
	"""
	Extracts the message and the handle from request. 
	inserts the message into the message database
	"""
	handle = request.form['handle'] #user input for handle
	usermessage = request.form['usermessage'] #user input for message
	print(handle,usermessage)
	db = get_message_db() #opens connection
	c = db.cursor() # creates a cursor to enter a query command

	#checks to see how many rows there are, this is necessary to create an ID
	#for each submission 
	x = c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows FROM messages') #get row count

	#retrieve row count, it is in form of tuple 
	test = x.fetchone()
	print(test)
	print(type(test)) #type: tuple, need to unpack
	(ID,) = test #tuple unpacked, stored in ID variable
	ID = ID + 1 #increment ID by one 
	print(ID)
	#question marks are substitutable values, stored in val variable
	insert_query = """INSERT OR IGNORE INTO messages (id,handle, message) VALUES (?,?,?)"""
	val = (ID, handle, usermessage) #fill in ?s in query, will concatanate in execute command 
	c.execute(insert_query,val)  
	print("executed order 66")

	# IMPORTANT: IN ORDER TO SAVE DATA, YOU MUST COMMIT IT
	# LIKE GITHUB
	db.commit() 
	print("db committed")
	print("finished insert_message method")

```

### The random_messages(n) method
The random_messages method is responsible for randomly displaying the submitted messages on the view messages page. The argument 'n' is passed to indicate the amount of messages shown. This method is called in conjunction with the view() method discussed later on.
```python
def random_messages(n):
	"""
	returns a collection of n random messages from the message_db, or fewer if necessary
	"""
	db = get_message_db();
	c = db.cursor();
	rows = c.execute('SELECT id FROM messages').fetchall()[-1]
	(rows,) = rows
	print(n,rows)
	if (rows < n):
		n = rows
		rando_query = """SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ? """
		c.execute(rando_query,(n,))
	else:
		rando_query = """SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT ? """
		c.execute(rando_query,(n,))
	return c

```
## Flask Methods

First and foremost, the line:
```python
app = Flask(__name__) 

```
is necessary to create our app. The __name__ argument is the name of our python application. This line creates a flask object which is responsible for routing to different pages on our webapp, among other things!
 
### Main 
Prior to declaration of methods for our flask object, we need to specify the url in which the functions will be activated. For example, for our main function we want the app.route("/") to have no specific url because we want it to be the first thing the user sees when navigating to our web app. This also offers insight as to why we call it the main() function, because we want to render our main.html template (discussed above). The render_function() method is a function that builds our html templates. We call it whenever we want to end our function and build our pages. 
```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
	return render_template("main.html")
#controls what url the page you develop will have
#root directory
```
### Submit
The submit function, routed to by navigating to the '/submit/' url, allows the user to make use of our insert message method implemented earlier. As you can see, when we specify the route, that there are two method, POST and GET. These two methods determine what actions to take when we are receiving data versus submitting data. When we are simply receiving the webapp interface (GET), we see the blank submit.html template;however, when we wish to submit data, the method is POST. Therefore, we call the insert message method, sending a users handle and message to our database. We then pass our template with the arguments gathered from the html forms. Finally, the thanks = True argument triggers a jinja block of code in our submit.html template that thanks the user for their input. 
```python

@app.route("/submit/", methods = ["POST", "GET"])
def submit():
	if request.method == "GET":
		return render_template("submit.html")
	if request.method == "POST":
		insert_message(request)
		print("message inserted") 
		return render_template("submit.html", handle = request.form["handle"], usermessage = request.form["usermessage"], thanks = True) 
```
Here is what our code looks like in action! 
![submit](/images/submit.png)
### View
This method is activated by navigating to the /view/ extension of our server! If you recall, it displays the id, handle, and message from 5 random users! 
```python

@app.route("/view/")
def view():
	db = get_message_db()
	rand_messages = random_messages(5)
	messages = rand_messages.fetchall()
	return render_template('view.html', messages = messages) 
	

```
This is what happens when you click on the 'View Messages' tab at the top to navigate to our /view/ url! 
![view](/images/view.png)
### Closing our database
The function close_message_db is responsible for ensuring that our connection to our database closes upon completion of database access.
```python
def close_message_db(e = None):
	"""This method breaks the connection to the database and closes it"""
	db = g.pop('message_db', None) #popping the element releases the connection, if no database, return none 

	if db is not None:
		print("sqlite3 closed")
		db.close()

```
You will notice,however, that is not called that much. That is because the following line of code does the work for us! Everytime we close the app the function specified in the argument is ran. In our case, we run our database closing method everytime!
```python
app.teardown_appcontext(close_message_db)
```

### CSS
```css
html {
    font-family: "Courier New",monospace;
    background: Cornflowerblue;
    padding: 1rem;
}

body {
    max-width: 900px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

    color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
    font-family:"Lucida Console", monospace;
    margin: 1rem 0;
    text-align: center;
}

a {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: none;
}

hr {
    border: none;
    border-top: 1px solid lightgray;
}

nav {
    background: darkcyan;
    padding: 0 0.5rem;
    border-radius: 25px;
}

nav ul  {
    display: flex;
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

nav ul li a {
    display: block;
    padding: 0.5rem;
}

.content {
    padding: 0 1rem 1rem;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 25px;
}

.flash {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 1em 0;
    padding: 1em;
    background: #cae6f6;
    border: 1px solid #377ba8;
}

```
