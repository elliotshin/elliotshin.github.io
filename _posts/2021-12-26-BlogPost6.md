## Blog Post 6
In this blog post we will be creating a tensorflow model that can determine whether or not a news article is fake! 

First let us import the necessary packages  we are working with!


```python
#import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import re
import string

from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import losses

from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import StringLookup
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# for embedding viz
import plotly.express as px 
import plotly.io as pio
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
```

### Part 1: Acquire Training Data
First things first, we need DATA! 

The following lines of code will allow us to access our training data for our model!


```python
#Data Acquisition 
train_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_train.csv?raw=true"
train_data = pd.read_csv(train_url)
```


```python
train_data.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>
      <th>title</th>

  </tbody>

### Part 2: Make A Dataset
Now we are going to make a function that removes stopwords such as "the", "and", and "but". These are words that do not provide any information that our model can use in determining whether or not our news articles are fake! The function will also return a tensorflow dataset object which takes in a title and the text of our news source and outputs the fake column from our data.

The following line of code imports "stopwords", or words that generally have no "meaning". These words are words we do not want our model to have to sift through and waste precious processing power on! 


```python
#need to import stopwords from a package online
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk

from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords') #import stopwords

```

    [nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...
    [nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!
    




    True



Now we are going to make our dataset, removing stopwords and creating a Tensorflow Dataset out of our pandas dataframe!


```python
def make_dataset(df):
  """
  Takes in the title and text of our article, removes stopwords, and 
  uses stopless free data as inputs to our tensorflow dataset
  Inputs for tensorflow Dataset:
    - title
    - text
  output:
    - fake column from our data_set
  """
  stop = stopwords.words('english')
  df['title'] = df['title'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
  df['text'] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
  data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
      (
          {
              "title": df['title'],
              "text":df['text']
          },
          {"fake": df["fake"]}
      )
  )
  return data
```

Now let's implement our function by calling it on our training data


```python
dataset = make_dataset(train_data).batch(100) #choice to omit batch or not 

```

The following line of code takes one batch of our data (100 rows) and prints the values of each title, text, and whether or not the article is fake.


```python
#checking our (batched) data
for title_text,fake in dataset.take(1):
  print(title_text)
  print(fake)
  print("")
```

           b'Donald Trump says Federal Reserve stoked asset bubbles backs congressional review decisions. Bernie Sanders also wants "audit" Fed make less beholden Wall Street. Ted Cruz calls return gold standard abandoned 1933. Such voices 2016 presidential campaign emboldened lawmakers seek limit Fed\'s powers prompting current former Fed officials call steps placate U.S. central bank\'s harshest critics. More dozen insiders Fed watchers said interviews concerned next president could sympathetic critics\' views Fed grown powerful impenetrable. Confronted possible Republican push give Congress say shaping Fed policy, insiders say concessions may necessary protect Fed\'s independence. "There\'s deep-seated institutional fear crack door open, kicked in. But often that\'s case," said David Stockton, Fed\'s former research director fellow Peterson Institute International Economics. The concerns among group, includes current former regional presidents, growing despite expectation Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, polls suggest win November, would help Fed preserve status-quo. The worries reflect balancing act central banks face world economy still sputters despite aggressive monetary easing. Central bankers getting blamed overstepping bounds enough bolster growth. Even U.S. economy outperforms, Fed especially vulnerable, ahead peers unwinding crisis-era stimulus. Chair Janet Yellen colleagues warned public speeches private meetings lawmakers initiatives make Fed accountable transparent could backfire. They defending decades-old, challenged, consensus Fed best safeguard long-term economic stability shielded direct political interference. The officials interviewed said Fed could take steps become open, responding promptly lawmaker requests information revealing rules thumb inform decisions rates. "The best response go defensive shell, instead Fed attempt influence terms changes coming," said Stockton. Some even embracing limited outside review Fed decisions - effectively version "audit" supported Trump, Sanders Cruz. While proposals Fed become open explaining informs decisions may get traction, interviewed acknowledge Fed leadership appears unlikely embrace audit major changes policy playbook. The Fed declined comment changes suggested interviews. Two separate bills proposed Republicans Senate House call government watchdog evaluate, "audit," policy decisions tie single policy rule Fed would adopt make public. Yellen colleagues say "audit" would expose Fed short-term political pressures, making policy less, predictable. The single rule policy would "severely impair" Fed\'s policymaking, Yellen warned, New York Fed President William Dudley compared going "on autopilot" face complex global challenges. Concern Republican initiatives particularly strong among 12 district presidents. Freshman Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari told February interview Fed\'s credibility suffered recent economic crisis. The central bank needs abandon "Wizard Oz routine" tells Americans "we mysterious, smart, can\'t understand doing," said. Narayana Kocherlakota, predecessor, told think Fed policy lacked public oversight, central bank address concerns offer solutions. "Optics matter," said. "Simply continue say \xe2\x80\x98we\'re really transparent reason us change we\'re things\' - I think that\'s going work." Shortcomings current approach reiterating Fed\'s criticism proposed changes plain view Yellen\'s latest congressional testimony Feb. 10. In run-up, Yellen held 10 private discussions lawmakers January alone, including call Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairs House Financial Services Committee backs rule-based policy bill. That however stop Hensarling putting Yellen spot, presenting letter prominent economists, including three Nobel Laureates several former Fed officials backed bill, labeling Yellen\'s warnings "apocalyptic" "hyperbolic." Yellen also taken task Democrats Fed\'s planned rate hikes said would disproportionately hurt minorities, saw cozy ties Wall Street. Kocherlakota, professor University Rochester, said scheduled audit, preferably every two years, "very manageable" way deal criticism avoid ad-hoc political meddling. In similar vein, Andrew Levin, former advisor Yellen, suggested Fed could meet halfway supporters rule-based policy disclosing benchmarks uses debates. "It\'s really hard understand Fed use benchmarks help explain they\'re doing," said Levin, Dartmouth College professor, citing example Taylor Rule rates tied levels inflation growth. By sharing information readily, Fed could also possibly improve relations Republicans, current former Fed officials said. That relationship strained drawn-out probe alleged 2012 leak sensitive policy details advisory firm Medley Global Advisors. Republican lawmakers requested transcripts information related case, Fed said limited much could disclose ongoing Justice Department investigation. Others say central bank open review regional structure dating back 1913, regional presidents selected. Today get picked district Fed directors appointed local bank groups Fed governors Washington, little public disclosure. The Fed Congress long history friction. A Brookings Institution paper published last week analyzed 879 bills proposed since 1947 found politicians usually try redefine Fed\'s powers economy falters, noting spike efforts since 2008 global financial crisis. The latest major changes came 1977 lawmakers clarified Fed\'s dual price stability employment mandate 2010, Dodd-Frank act gave Fed greater supervisory powers setting limits future emergency lending autonomy conduct it.

Now that we have our tensorflow Dataset, we can break it apart into training and validation data!


```python
#Creating Validation Data 
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size = len(dataset))

train_size = int(0.8 *len(dataset))
val_size = int(0.2 * len(dataset))

train = dataset.take(train_size) 
val = dataset.skip(train_size).take(val_size)
```


```python
#testing to make sure that the data splits are about 80:20
len(train),len(val), len(dataset)
```




    (180, 45, 225)



Let's examine what the base rate of our model would be! This is done by calculating the frequency of whether or not an article was marked as fake or not! Basically, this is telling us how accurate our model would be if it just guessed that every model was fake! 


```python
## Assessing Base Rate
type(train_data)
train_data["fake"].value_counts()

```




    1    11740
    0    10709
    Name: fake, dtype: int64




```python
#articles are fake about 
11740/(11740 + 10709)
#of the time
```




    0.522963160942581



A "base model rate" would be abot 52%. Hopefully our models will perform better than this

Now let's prepare our data by vectorizing the text and title of each article! We are essentially going to be converting every word into a number so that our model can learn associations between each numerical value


```python
##Data Prep: Vectorizing our Data
#Does frequency of capitalization and punctuation give indication for authenticity of article?
size_vocabulary = 2000
def standardization(input_data):
    lowercase = tf.strings.lower(input_data)
    no_punctuation = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercase,
                                  '[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation),'')
    return no_punctuation 

vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(
    standardize=standardization,
    max_tokens=size_vocabulary, # only consider this many words
    output_mode='int',
  ) 
vectorize_layer.adapt(train.map(lambda x, y: x['title']))
vectorize_layer.adapt(train.map(lambda x, y: x['text']))

```

## Creating our Models
Now we are going to create our models using the functional API! This helps us with specifying specific inputs so we can answer the question: 

**When detecting fake news, is it most effective to focus on only the title of the article, the full text of the article, or both?**


### Model 1: Title Model
Let's see if title is a good indicator of article authenticity


```python
## Model 1: Only the Article Title
size_vocabulary = 2000
#specify inputs into our functional model
title_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,),
    name = "title",
    dtype = "string"
)
#create hidden layers of our model
title_features = vectorize_layer(title_input)
title_features = layers.Embedding(size_vocabulary, 10, name = "embedding")(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.2)(title_features)
title_features = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.2)(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dense(2, activation = 'relu')(title_features)
```


```python
#specifying our models output 
main = title_features
output = layers.Dense(2, name = 'fake')(main)
```


```python
#creating our model
title_model = keras.Model(
    inputs = title_input,
    outputs = output
)
```


```python
#examining our model! 
title_model.summary()
```

Wow, it seems that our title model can accurately assess whether or not an article is fake **about 98%** of the time! That is pretty impressive

### Text Model
Let's see if using just the actual text of an article creates a better model than the title! This is essentially the same exact process as above except now we want to specify just the text as our input!


```python
## Text Model
text_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,),
    name = "text",
    dtype = "string"
)
text_features = vectorize_layer(text_input)
text_features = layers.Embedding(size_vocabulary, 10, name = "embedding2")(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.2)(text_features)
text_features = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.2)(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dense(2, activation = 'relu')(text_features)
```


```python
main = text_features
output = layers.Dense(2, name = 'fake')(main)

```


```python
text_model = keras.Model(
    inputs = text_input,
    outputs = output

text_model.compile(optimizer = "adam",

              metrics = ['accuracy']
)
              
```

It seems that our text only model has an accuracy of **barely 99 % **. This is better than our title only model

### Model 3: Title and Text
Let's evaluate whether or not our model can predict the authenticity of an article better if both the text and title are used as inputs! 

Let's first shuffle our original data so that our model is not able to learn from prior data. 


```python
## Creating a new Dataset to work with!
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size = len(dataset))

train_size = int(0.8 *len(dataset))
val_size = int(0.2 * len(dataset))

train_2 = dataset.take(train_size) 
val_2 = dataset.skip(train_size).take(val_size)
```


```python
#ensuring that the two datasets will be different
train == train_2,val == val_2
```




    (False, False)



Looks like we have successfully created new training and validating data by reshuffling our Dataset!

This is the first major divergence from the prior models, as you can see we need to concatenate the prior models layers into one while maintaining the same output!


```python
#use concatenate to combine our two models together to predict output
main = layers.concatenate([title_features,text_features], axis = 1)
main = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(main)
output = layers.Dense(2, name = "fake")(main)
```


```python
dual_model = keras.Model(
    inputs = [title_input,text_input],
    outputs = output
)
```


```python
dual_model.summary()
```

Wow! So the dual model that uses both title and text as inputs clearly overperforms the other two models! That is extremely high accuracy! It is **almost 100%**!

## Part 4: Testing the Best on the Test Set
Now that we have determined that the dual model of both title and text performs the highest, let's test it on some test data! 

First, we have to import:


```python
# Acquiring new Data
test_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_test.csv?raw=true"
```


```python
test = pd.read_csv(test_url)
```


```python
#applying our make_dataset function from before
test_data = make_dataset(test).batch(100)
```


```python
#Looking at our Data
for title_text,fake in test_data.take(1):
  print(title_text)
  print(fake)
  print("")
```

Under U.S. President Donald Trump, Labor Department continued fight challenge Obama administration-era rule raise pay threshold overtime eligibility. But endorsed former administration\'s move nearly double threshold, increase strongly opposed business groups. The Labor Department told federal appeals court Friday power use salaries set thresholds mandatory overtime pay, without advocating $47,500 maximum salary level set department Obama. The Labor Department challenging November decision federal judge Texas blocked Obama rule, decision department said could prevent setting new threshold set Obama administration. The Obama rule expected extend overtime pay eligibility 4 million salaried workers. Nevada 20 states sued last year block rule.

           b'BAYAMON, Puerto Rico/NEW YORK,Along stretch highway suburban Bayamon, Puerto Rico, construction workers tried desperately make progress repairing 100-foot-long sinkhole clouds rolled in. Previous rains suspended work, workers watched earth fall back hole. It wanted stop raining since Hurricane Maria, said Carlos Rivera, 26-year-old contract worker site last month. Cars backed miles along Puerto Rico Highway 2 either side colossal construction site, swallowed four five lanes. The 20-foot crater among thousands sites damaged storm exposed already fragile infrastructure Puerto Rico, decimating water, power roadways once. Fixing one sinkhole required maneuvering set vexing logistical financial hurdles reveal rebuilding isolated island take much time work storm-ravaged region mainland United States. The hole one 3,500 reported incidents hurricane damage Puerto Rico-owned roadways, repair costs estimated $250 million. A U.S. territory, Puerto Rico already trouble Maria hit Sept. 20 strongest storm strike island nine decades. Its economy recession decade, pushing island bankruptcy restructure $120 billion bond pension debt. The task rebuilding made much harder challenges expense bringing supplies equipment island, depend heavily U.S. aid likely struggle finance expected share rebuilding. The storm cut power cell service, felled trees, destroyed 230,000 homes damaged another 400,000. One casualties stretch Highway 2, vital 143-mile artery San Juan Ponce. Running west San Juan looping south, road transports thousands people day San Juan suburbs island bustling capital. Hurricane Maria rains flooded pipes Highway 2 one burst. Water gushed old pipe deep roadway, scouring hole ground eventually collapsed. Officials could ignore sinkhole, squeezed eastbound traffic single westbound lane detoured westbound traffic. Tempers began fray residents endured one-mile drive nearly hour. The problem fell Puerto Rico Transportation Public Works Secretary Carlos Contreras Aponte. His department oversees island Highway Transportation Authority (PRHTA), manages third Puerto Rico 9,300 miles roadway. The pressing problem facing Contreras logistics: rebuild road power, limited trucks, electrical light, cell phones. As week, less half island power restored, according Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Puerto Rico antiquated electric grid decimated storm needs complete rebuild. Electricity required run machinery used extracting rock raw materials produce asphalt. Since storm, contractors bring diesel-powered generators power machinery, cumbersome expensive task, Contreras said. That something happening every industry here, creating shortage generators, Contreras said. Another scarce commodity: trucks. With much population cut power communication, island forced divert hundreds trucks drivers help bring supplies needy citizens. That left vehicles behind transport equipment materials needed fix infrastructure, including Highway 2 sinkhole. The truck drivers, many hired companies, secretary said. Among competing trucks: Puerto Rico water sewer authority, known PRASA. PRASA president Eli Diaz-Atienza told interview October agency 125 trucks service island 3.4 million residents. He requested trucks FEMA, tapped U.S. Army National Guard vehicles, contracted private sector firms repurpose vehicles milk trucks. We never enough trucks, Diaz said. Replacements damaged traffic signals Puerto Rico 1,200 intersections must flown island states, expensive complicated process trucking them. We supplies Puerto Rico never repair equipment intersections once, Contreras said. Through all, communications remain problem. With cell service iffy, roads department resorted using runners travel hours areas island without phone service relay reports damage. The travel time word-of-mouth communication led incorrect, incomplete confusing information delays, Contreras said. Sometimes get description problem, send technical people, completely different story, explained. One problem particular sinkhole managed avoid money. Because lay major thoroughfare, Contreras decided prioritize it, funding repairs expected $1 million $42.5 million emergency funds Federal Highway Administration. Puerto Rico officials could reached comment final costs time required repair roadway. But witness drove Highway 2 week said area paved traffic moving easily. The triage process pits rebuilding projects others reflects broader financial ruin Puerto Rico. Initial U.S. aid packages nearly enough, agencies like PRHTA - cities towns, - rely heavily U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency finance rebuilding long term. No municipality Puerto Rico money build infrastructure needed, said Angel Perez, mayor Guaynabo, damage municipal property estimated $25 million $30 million - big hit San Juan suburb whose total budget $130 million. Cash-strapped cities towns also scrambling pay front costs rebuilding projects. In major emergency, Puerto Rico treated U.S. state, FEMA spokesman said. It eligible FEMA aid types federal funds made available state suffers catastrophe, said. Rebuilding aid typically conditioned cost-sharing agreement would require Puerto Rico match quarter expenses. That share reduced 10 percent month, White House said. Still, Puerto Rico financial crisis crippling blow storm mean territory could still hard-pressed put share. The longer projects take, costly get, Contreras said, relentless Caribbean rain continues erode damaged stretches highway, particularly buried mudslides. At Highway 2 sinkhole, construction worker Silvano Monica, 62, said work small start: There roads bridges problems like island.',

Several legal experts agreed Comey\'s conclusion recent precedent bringing case without evidence willful intent gross negligence, said would difficult convince jury convict Clinton based evidence. "Extreme carelessness necessarily translate gross negligence," said Laurie Levenson, professor law Loyola Law School Los Angeles former federal prosecutor. "The times I seen statutes used situations people knew disclosing classified, confidential information, could show really care," Levenson said. Comey said investigators determined Clinton exchanged 110 emails contained government secrets staff known information classified. But unlike cases prosecuted Espionage Act, FBI suggested Clinton intentionally shared government secrets people authorized see them. The statute charging gross negligence Espionage Act, written 1917, requires information "removed proper place," tough legal requirement digital age, said Stephen Vladeck, law professor University Texas.

Comey said FBI "did find clear evidence Secretary Clinton colleagues intended violate laws governing handling classified information." But said find "evidence extremely careless handling sensitive, highly classified information." His recommendation, Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously said would accept, angered Republicans said actions punished. Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump reacted news Twitter account, saying, "The system rigged. General Petraeus got trouble far less." In case, FBI recommended felony charge. But Attorney General Eric Holder pursued misdemeanor another part law, Petraeus pleaded guilty. He sentenced two years probation 2015.

This is a really robust model! It seems it can predict whether or not a model is fake with about 99% accuracy! Now we can break down what exactly our embedding layers for our title and text picked up on!

## Part 5: Visualing What the Model Learned
Now by examing our embedding layers, we can see what words the model picked up on and how they relate to authenticity of our news sources!


```python
dual_model_weights = dual_model.get_layer('embedding2').get_weights()[0]
vocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()
```

It seems that words in the direction towards the bottom right of the visualization have to do with politics, particulary those pertaining to the president! We can see this due to the mentions of "barack","trumps", "obamas" and "clintons"! 

I am a bit curious to see if perhaps adding a third component will help us narrow down more categories of words! Let's repeat hte process above bu specify three components and plot them! 


```python
## 3D Model
pca = PCA(n_components = 3)
weights = pca.fit_transform(dual_model_weights)
```


```python
embedding_df_3d = pd.DataFrame({
    'word' : vocab, 
    'x0'   : weights[:,0],
    'x1'   : weights[:,1],
    'x2'    : weights[:,2]
})
embedding_df_3d
```

I think I would interpret words in the -x0 direction, -x1 direction, and positive x2 direction as pertaining to media/news outlets. Words such as "fox", "leftist","screen", "liberal", "daily", and "press" seem to support this interpretation!

## Conclusion 
As you can see, we were able to construct an extremely accurate model to classify authenticity of news articles! We were able to analyze the word embeddings to intrepret how our model classified certain words and their importance to the model!
