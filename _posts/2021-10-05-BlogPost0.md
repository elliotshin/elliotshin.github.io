## Introduction
Hi! My Name is Elliot Shin, and today I will be guiding you through creating a data visualization using the Palmer Penguins pandas dataframe!
No need to be alarmed, as we will only be looking at Penguins, and not pandas. Pandas simply refers to the package in python that makes working with data a little bit easier. It also comes with some cool useful functions for creating plots! 

## Step 1: Importing the Data
First, we need to get the data!
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

```
The first line is us importing the pandas package and renaming it pd for the purposes of this assignment. This is the conventional style, as it saves some time (plus all the posts on stack overflow regarding pandas refer to it as pd as well).
